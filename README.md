Please let us know if there are any problems.
The API exists to add marine forecast information to your product. It’s not a license to replicate the locational database we’ve created on MSW. This locational data remains our intellectual property and thus we don't provide an API for this data. Additionally the API isn’t designed for the building of applications that replicate core functionality found on the MSW website and we reserve the right to terminate applications that do this.
